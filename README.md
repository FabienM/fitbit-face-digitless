##### Customizable colors

Background and text colors are customizables.

## Future enhancements

##### Better fonts

While the original design has pretty nice fonts, this version sticks to the defaults FitbitOS fonts, with a disappointing feeling.

##### Customizable indicators

As of today, the heartrates, steps and calories indicators are hard-coded in this order.

More indicators could be supported and reordering could be permitted.

##### More languages

At the time being, only english and french are supported. More languages should come.
