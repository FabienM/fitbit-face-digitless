## License

Design is exclusive property of [vurggodzns](https://www.facer.io/user/XLR9AscBPt).

## Features

##### Second-hand

The middle bar grow with seconds.

##### Customizable colors

Background and text colors are customisables.

## Future enhancements

##### Better fonts

While the original design has pretty nice fonts, this version sticks to the defaults FitbitOS fonts, with a disappointing feeling.

##### Cleaner first screen

As in original design, only the hours should appear in a white font at screen wake-up.
Middle bar, indicators and date should reveal on user "click". 

##### Customizable indicators

Today, the heartrates, steps and calories indicators are hard-coded in this order.

More indicators could be supported and reordering could be permitted.

##### More languages

At the time being, only english and french are supported. More languages should come.
